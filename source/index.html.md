# Introduction

Welcome to the <strong>Trusted Works API</strong>! You can use our API to access Trusted Works API endpoints, which can get information on various Trusted entities.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: my_api_token"
```

> Make sure to replace `my_api_token` with your API key.

Trusted Works API uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Trusted Works API key in your [Works admin page](https://app.workshealth.com/works/).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

Trusted Works API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>&lsaquo;token&rsaquo;</code> with your personal API key.
